# particles

To run this project, open the sample.cpp in Visual Studio 2019, and add particles.cl as an added file.
Then build the project and watch it run.

I have built two cylinders within the main sample.cpp file, which are colored red and blue.

I also have a cube of particles that are all randomly colored. There will be a GUI that pops up, and when you click go/start the cube of particles will drop onto the 2 cylinders.

Once any of the particles bounce off the two cylinders, that particles color changes to whatever the cylinders color is.

Here is a link to what it should look like. The screen recording was kind of bad, and I couldn't figure out a better way to screen record, so this was the best I could do.
